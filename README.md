# TdP & QT Risk Assessment Web Tool

This project is a browser-based implementation of the TdP (Torsades de Pointes) and QTc risk calculator originally developed in MATLAB. It uses Hill curve fitting and logistic models to estimate cardiac arrhythmia risk based on concentration–FPDc data.

## Features

- Add custom concentration–FPDc data
- Hill curve fitting using in-browser optimization
- Model 1 & Model 2 risk probabilities
- QTc threshold estimation
- Interactive plots (Hill curve and TdP risk bars)

## Technologies

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Chart.js (for plotting)
- Math.js (for fitting logic)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Input data, click "Submit," and view results.
